## 🎯 About Me

I’m a venture capital investor turned aspiring software builder.
After 15+ years in the investment world — with the last 5 of those in VC — I’ve decided to up my skills and become a software developer. This is in order for me to have an even deeper understanding and appreciation of the companies that my firm invests in.

my ultimate goal is to gain a foundational understanding of software development, build tools that make our VC processes smarter and more efficient, and better connect with the brilliant founders shaping the future.

💻 I’m looking forward to getting to a point where i can build my own software to enhance my firm's investment process, and i find it so exciting to be working and learning software development, in the age of AI and other advancements.
☕ When I’m not coding, i'm meeting with founders that are using technology to solve real worl problems and learning about the fascinating businesses that are out there!

## 🚀 Fun Fact

💡 one of my favourite quotes is..."The most difficult subjects can be explained ti the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him." - Leo Tolstoy
